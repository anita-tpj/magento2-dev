If you are ordering multiple finishes, you may receive separate shipments depending on which warehouses they are being shipped from.

27,"What is a curbside, end-of-truck delivery?","<p>If shipping to a residential address, it is a curbside, end of truck delivery. Curbside, meaning the delivery will be made either at the curb or in your driveway, depending on what the driver deems the easiest and safest way to deliver your order. End of truck, meaning the driver is only responsible for moving the pallet to the end of the truck. From that point, it is the customer&rsquo;s responsibility to unload the pallet piece by piece (this is a perfect time to do a piece count and inspect each box for damage).</p>",1,4,"1,2"
28,What is a lift gate?,"<p>The lift gate is like an 'elevator' on the back of the freight truck that lowers the pallet onto the curb. You would then unload the pallet from the curb as opposed to the back of the truck. <span>Certain orders will not be able to use a lift gate due to the size of the pallets used for delivery. If your order is able to utilize a lift gate, it will be automatically included on your delivery free of charge!</span></p>",1,4,"1,2"
29,Will I be able to accept my delivery by myself?,"<p>Many cabinets will be very large and heavy (in excess of 100 lbs) so having 1 or 2 additional people to help is highly recommended. The delivery drivers work for the freight companies (not TheRTAStore.com) and for insurance purposes, are not able to assist in unloading any cabinets so he or she would not be able to help during this process.</p>",1,4,1
30,What do I need to do on delivery besides unload the cabinets/accessories?,"<p>1. It is extremely important that you <span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;>do a piece count</span> and make sure all ordered pieces are there (unless you&rsquo;ve been informed of any out of stock items). Some pieces may be packaged together, i.e. crown molding, fillers, etc&hellip; If you can, open any accessory boxes while the driver is there to make sure all pieces are accounted for, if you&rsquo;re not able to, mark the Bill of Lading (BOL &ndash; shipping paperwork that the driver has) that you weren&rsquo;t able to verify the piece count in that specific box. If there is anything missing, it must be noted on the BOL. Make sure to get a copy of the BOL with the driver&rsquo;s signature and that the driver has a copy noting any shortages, we will need a copy sent to us to process your replacement order.&nbsp;<strong><span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;>If shortages are not noted on the BOL, we will not be able to reship these items for no charge</span>. </strong></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>2. In addition to doing a piece count, you want to check each box for visible damage. The trucking company is required to let you check the outside of each box. <span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;>You do not need to open each box</span>, just check over the outside for cracks, dents, holes, etc&hellip; If the driver tells you they will not wait for you to check over the boxes, call the trucking company and explain that you need to note any visible damage on the BOL and the driver is giving you a hard time (this is not very common). The number to the trucking company will be on the BOL. The boxes are checked in the warehouses before being shipped out, however, as soon as the trucking company picks up your order, they are responsible for any damages that occur in transit and will only approve replacements if the damages are noted on the shipping paperwork (Bill of Lading &ndash; BOL) on your delivery.</p>",1,4,"1,2"
31,"When I receive delivery, what if something on my order is damaged​ or missing​?​","<p>It is very important to look for any damages to the outside of the boxes upon your delivery.

34,Will I receive a new cabinet if something is damaged in the box?,"<p>Depending on the damage, in most cases, a replacement part will be sent, not an entire new cabinet. The manufacturer reserves the right to determine the most cost effective and efficient method to correct damaged and/or defective cabinets/accessories. For example, if a door is cracked, you would receive a new door, not a whole new cabinet.

37,What if I ordered cabinets with glass and the glass arrives broken?,"<p>If Glass Door Inserts or Glass Shelves are damaged during shipment, the manufacturers will not re-ship since they would have to ship via Ground and will more than likely be damaged again.

The manufacturers have very strict policies about discounts only applying to orders placed during these times. We often have no prior knowledge of the discounts that will be available until they are posted on the website so because of this, we are not able to honor discounts for current sales on past orders even if the order was just placed or has not shipped yet. Orders that are cancelled because current sale discounts cannot be applied may be subject to restocking fees and/or initial and return shipping charges (if the order has already been shipped and is in transit).
